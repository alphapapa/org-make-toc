;;; org-make-toc.el --- Automatic tables of contents for Org files  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2020 Adam Porter

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc
;; Version: 0.5
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1") (dash "2.12") (s "1.10.0") (org "9.0"))
;; Keywords: Org, convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; This package makes it easy to have one or more customizable tables of contents in Org files.
;; They can be updated manually, or automatically when the file is saved.  Links to headings are
;; created compatible with GitHub's Org renderer.

;;;; Installation

;; Install the packages `dash' and `s'.  Then put this file in your `load-path', and put this in
;; your init file:

;;   (require 'org-make-toc)

;;;; Usage

;; A document may have any number of tables of contents (TOCs), each of
;; which may list entries in a highly configurable way.  To make a basic
;; TOC, follow these steps:
;;
;; 1.  Choose a heading to contain a TOC and go to it.
;; 2.  Press `C-c C-x p' (`org-set-property'), add a `TOC' property, and
;;     set its value to `:include all'.
;; 3.  Run command `org-make-toc-insert' to insert the `:CONTENTS:' drawer,
;;     which will contain the TOC entries.
;; 4.  Run the command `org-make-toc' to update all TOCs in the document,
;;     or `org-make-toc-at-point' to update the TOC for the entry at point.
;;
;;
;; Example
;; ═══════
;;
;;   Here's a simple document containing a simple TOC:
;;
;;   ┌────
;;   │ * Heading
;;   │ :PROPERTIES:
;;   │ :TOC:      :include all
;;   │ :END:
;;   │
;;   │ This text appears before the TOC.
;;   │
;;   │ :CONTENTS:
;;   │ - [[#heading][Heading]]
;;   │   - [[#subheading][Subheading]]
;;   │ :END:
;;   │
;;   │ This text appears after it.
;;   │
;;   │ ** Subheading
;;   └────
;;
;;
;; Advanced
;; ════════
;;
;;   The `:TOC:' property is a property list which may set these keys and
;;   values.
;;
;;   These keys accept one setting, like `:include all':
;;
;;   ⁃ `:include' Which headings to include in the TOC.
;;     • `all' Include all headings in the document.
;;     • `descendants' Include the TOC's descendant headings.
;;     • `siblings' Include the TOC's sibling headings.
;;   ⁃ `:depth' A number >= 0 indicating a depth relative to this heading.
;;     Descendant headings at or above this relative depth are included in
;;     TOCs that include this heading.
;;
;;   These keys accept either one setting or a list of settings, like
;;   `:force depth' or `:force (depth ignore)':
;;
;;   ⁃ `:force' Heading-local settings to override when generating the TOC
;;     at this heading.
;;     • `depth' Override `:depth' settings.
;;     • `ignore' Override `:ignore' settings.
;;   ⁃ `:ignore' Which headings, relative to this heading, to exclude from
;;     TOCs.
;;     • `descendants' Exclude descendants of this heading.
;;     • `siblings' Exclude siblings of this heading.
;;     • `this' Exclude this heading (not its siblings or descendants).
;;   ⁃ `:local' Heading-local settings to ignore when generating TOCs at
;;     higher levels.
;;     • `depth' Ignore `:depth' settings.
;;
;;   See [example.org] for a comprehensive example of the features
;;   described above.

;;
;;
;; Automatically update on save
;; ════════════════════════════
;;
;;   To automatically update a file's TOC when the file is saved, use the
;;   command `add-file-local-variable' to add `org-make-toc' to the Org
;;   file's `before-save-hook'.
;;
;;   Or, you may activate it in all Org buffers like this:
;;
;;   ┌────
;;   │ (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-make-toc-mode)
