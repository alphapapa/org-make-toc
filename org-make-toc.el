;;; org-make-toc.el --- Automatic tables of contents for Org files  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2018 Adam Porter

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc
;; Version: 0.4-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1") (dash "2.12") (s "1.10.0") (org "9.0"))
;; Keywords: Org, convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; This package makes it easy to have one or more customizable tables of contents in Org files.
;; They can be updated manually, or automatically when the file is saved.  Links to headings are
;; created compatible with GitHub's Org renderer.

;;;; Installation

;; Install the packages `dash' and `s'.  Then put this file in your `load-path', and put this in
;; your init file:

;;   (require 'org-make-toc)

;;;; Usage

;; 1.  Make a heading in the Org file where you want the table of contents, and give it the Org
;; property "TOC" with the value "this".

;; 2.  Run the command `org-make-toc'.

;;;;; Advanced

;; A document may contain multiple tables of contents.  Tables of contents can be customized by
;; setting the "TOC" property of headings to these values:

;; +  "all": Include all headings in the file, except ignored headings.
;; +  "children": Include only child headings of this ToC.
;; +  "siblings": Include only sibling headings of this ToC.
;; +  "ignore": Omit a heading from the TOC.
;; +  "ignore-children" or "0": Omit a heading's child headings from the TOC.
;; +  a number "N": Include child headings no more than "N" levels deep in the TOC.

;;;;; Automatically update on save

;; To automatically update a file's TOC when the file is saved, use the command
;; "add-file-local-variable" to add "org-make-toc" to the Org file's "before-save-hook".

;; Or, you may activate it in all Org buffers like this:

;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-make-toc-mode)
